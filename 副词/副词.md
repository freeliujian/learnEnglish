`副词是：`**修饰动词，形容词，副词的词语。有时也可以修饰数词，介词，连词，名词或全局**
**副词**：时间副词，地点副词，方式副词主要作状语，程度副词用来修饰形容词和方式副词，频度副词作状语，只是位置不同

## 时间副词
| now | soon马上 | ago | every day |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| today  | tomorrow | yesterday | tonight |
| just now 刚才 | early/late | before | finally |
| eventually 最后 | once 曾经 | recently 最近 | already |
| just  | lately | immediately立即 | just then然后 |

注：already,just,lately和before多用于完成时态。
时间副词作时间状语可以放在主谓宾和主系表结构句型后面
`1、主语 + 谓语+宾语 +时间副词`
`2、主语+be+表语+时间副词`
```
I am liatening to music now.
I am learning English now.
```
注：now不能使用在一般现在时态主谓宾。特殊情况下可以用在一般过去时或者将来时，那么意思为“目前”而不是”现在此刻“比如：
```
I am busy now.
She is tired now.
```
soon 主要用来一般将来时态。比如：
```
I will go home soon.
I will finish this task soon.
```
ago 不能单独使用，前面需要加表示时间长度的词语
```
I was a middle school student two years ago.
I bought a watermelon two days ago.
```
every day 一般用于一般现在时：
```
She does her homework every day.
I am busy every day.
```
today一般用在一般过去时或者将来。
```
It's fine today.
Im busy today.
I ate two apple today.
I will buy many apples today.
```
tomorrow一般用来将来时态
```
They will go to America tomorrow.
```
early 和 late 一般用一般现在，一般过去，一般将来。经常还会加其他时间状语
```
He goes to school early.
I get up early every day.
I will be late.
I will get up late tomorrow.
```
tonight 和 today用法一样
just now 用于一般过去时
```
I washed my face just now.
I was busy just now.
```
少数时间副词可以作后置定语，yesterday，today，tomorrow、
```
The meeting today is very important.
The lesson tomorrow is easy.
```

时间副词的一些特殊的：
Last + 表时间的名词单数，这个last 表示上一个的意思
`last week`
Next + 表时间的名词单数，和next一致,表示下一个意思
`next week`
this/that + 表时间的名词单数,比如:
`this morning`
一般用于一般过去或者一般将来时
```
I got up late this morning.
```
## 地点副词
| here | there | downstairs楼上 | upstairs楼下 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| home  | above 在上面 | back  | upwards 向上 |
| nearby 附近 | outside 在外面 | off 离开 | down |
| up | aborad |  around周围 | everywhere到处 |
| indoors 户内 | outdoors 户外 | anywhere 到处（否定） |  |

地点副词做地点状语。并不是每一个地点副词可以作地点状语.
```
I am visiting a friend here.
I am happy here.
```
少数地点副词，如`here,there,home,abroad,upstairs,downstairs,around,indoors,outdoors.`等可以作后置定语。
```
The woman upstairs is sexy. 楼上的女人很性感
Joe likes the girl upstairs. joe喜欢楼上的女孩
The houses there are expensive. 这些房子很贵
```
少数地点副词可以作宾补。能加地点副词作宾补的及物动词就更少了，如：`let，leave，keep，put`
```
let him out.
put it down.
```
## 方式副词
表示动作方式的赐予叫`方式副词`，大部分放在句尾。也有放前面的，表示强调。大部分方式副词都是由`形容词+ly`构成，也有独立的，比如`hard（努力的），fast(快)`。`friendly，lovely`ly结尾但是是形容词。
常见方式副词：

| carefully | fast | angrily | warmly热心地 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| suddenly突然地 | slowly慢慢地 | excitedly兴奋地 | quickly很快地 |
| loudly大声地 | bravely勇敢地 | patiently耐心地 |  |

方式副词句子大概由两个句型构成
（1）主语+及物动词（谓语）+宾语+方式副词（方式状语）
（2）主语+不及物动词 + 方式副词
```
I love you very much.
I like your book very much.
She cried suddenly.
They run fast.
We run slowly.
```
时间副词，地点副词和方式副词都可以做状语，都放在句尾。一般顺序为：
方式副词==》地点副词==》时间副词
```
She didi her homework carfully upstairs last night.
He is working hard outside now
My brother reads English loudly upstairs every day.
```
## 程度副词
| Almost 几乎 | nearly 几乎 |  vary  | Rather相当 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| fairly 相当 | so 如此，很 | much | quite相当，十分 |
| pretty | extremely 非常 | too | super |
| really 真正地 | completely完全 | extraordinarily格外地 |  |

一般修饰形容词和方式副词，比如
```
very good
so good
pretty good
too bad
almost/naerly dead
extremely cold 及其冷
```
"much" 这次个词语做程度副词，必须修饰形容词方式副词的比较，表示”...得多“
```
much better 好得多了
much barder 难多了
```
## 频度副词
| already | often | usually | sometimes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| seldom 很少 | occasionally 偶尔 | never 从不 |  |

频度副词也是做状语，比如
```

```
## 特殊副词

```
## 副词的比较级和最高级

方式副词只能做状语，修饰动词，放在动词的句子后面。
